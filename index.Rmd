# Overview

This website will feature some worked examples from different areas of statistics.

You can also check out my larger articles on [my website](https://zhigenlin.com).

Plotting example in R.

1. Create data.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(10)
y = rnorm(10)
```

2. Plot.

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

## Bayesian models

### Regression example

Assume a Poisson probability model:

$Y|x \sim Poisson(\theta_{x})$

$Y$: number of offspring

$x$: age of bird


Poisson regression model with log-link

$Y|x \sim Poisson(exp(\mathbf{\beta}^T\textbf{x}))$

where

$logE[Y|x] = log(\theta_x) = \beta_1+\beta_2x+\beta_3x^2$.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x = rnorm(10)
y = rnorm(10)
```

2. Plot.

```{r}
plot(x,y)
```
